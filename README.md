# MMOC

My 8th imperative programming assignment

 Write a program to take a product code from Millie's Mail-Order Catalog
 seperate it into its component part.
 
 An MMOC product code begins with one or more letters identifying the warehouse
 where the product is stored.
 Next come the one or more digits that are the product ID.
 The final field of the string starts with a capital letter and represents
 qualifiers such as size, color and so on.
 
 Example: ATL1203S14
 
 Product: 1203
 Qualifier: S14
 Warehouse: ATL (Atlanta)
